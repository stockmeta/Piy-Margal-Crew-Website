CSS:

CSS declarations consist of a property and value.
PROPERTY - the property you'd like to style of that element (i.e., size, color, etc.).
VALUE - the value of the property (i.e., 18px for size, blue for color, etc.).

The property and value are separated by a colon (:). A semicolon (;) should always be used at the end of a declaration.

Example:
h1 {
   size: 18px;
   color: blue;
}

----------

font-family property is where you use fonts

Example:
h1 {
   font-family: Georgia;
}

font-size property is where you use the size of the fonts by "px" or pixels

p  {
   font-size: 18px;
}

Note:

- What is a pixel and is this the only measure of font size?

- A pixel is one of several units of measure in web development. It is an absolute unit equal to 1/96 of an inch.

- Rems and ems are scalable typographic units which are commonly used with the font-size property. As opposed to pixels, both of these units are relative.
For example, an em is measured relative to the font-size of an element. When dealing with ems it is important to realize that the font-size of an
element is often inherited from an ancestor element. On the other hand, rems are determined based on the font-size of the html element. If font-size
is not defined on the html element, the browser’s default font-size is used instead (usually 16px).

There are pros and cons of each unit but one major advantage of using relative units is that they lend themselves more naturally to responsive design.
Relative units like ems and rems are flexible and scalable whereas pixels are not.


the font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears.

p  {
   font-weight: bold;
}
